# Tomasz Wilczega 👋

Quantitative Asset Manager | CFA | Designing Investment Solutions

10+ years designing, developing, and deploying quantitative solutions across buy-side, sell-side, and fintech. I bridge the gap between quantitative research and production systems — from alpha generation to automated execution.

Co-creator of [BeGlobal](https://beglobal.pl), Poland's first robo-advisor.

### What I Do

```
Quantitative Research  →  Strategy Development  →  Production Systems  →  Automated Execution
```

I build end-to-end quantitative infrastructure: backtesting frameworks, forecasting models, portfolio optimization, and automated trading pipelines.

### Projects

Most of my quant work lives in private repos — no free alpha! 😄
